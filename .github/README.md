# Maze Game - DFS & Prim Algorithms

A simple yet engaging maze game built by [Son Nguyen](https://github.com/hoangsonww) in 2024. Navigate through a dynamically generated maze to find the exit. Each time you play, a new maze is created, ensuring a unique experience. The game is designed to be lightweight and easy to play, making it suitable for all age groups. 

However, creating it is a pain in the brain, so I hope you'll enjoy it! Star the repository if you like it and feel free to contribute to the project ðŸŒŸ.

## Features

- **Randomized Maze Generation**: Each game loads a new maze, thanks to the Depth-First Search (DFS) and Prim algorithms used for maze generation.
- **Player Navigation**: Use the arrow keys to move up, down, left, or right within the maze.
- **Start and Exit Indicators**: The game visually indicates the starting point and the exit. Reach the green block to win.
- **Regenerate Maze**: A button allows players to generate a new maze at any time without reloading the page.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the game canvas and control elements.
- **CSS**: Styling of the game canvas and alignment of game elements.
- **JavaScript**: Game logic, including maze generation, player movement, collision detection, and UI interaction. Implemented using DFS and Prim algorithms.
- **Python**: There is also a Python implementation of the maze generation algorithm using the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm.

## Maze Generation Algorithm

The maze is generated using a randomized version of the Depth-First Search (DFS) & Prim algorithms. This algorithm starts at a random cell, marks it as part of the maze, and recursively explores unvisited neighbors, carving out a path. The process continues until all cells are visited, resulting in a perfect maze with a single solution.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser.
3. Alternatively, you can run the Python implementation of the maze generation algorithm by executing the `maze.py` file.

```bash
python maze-gen.py
```

Before running the Python script, ensure that you have Python and Pygame installed on your machine.
```bash
pip install pygame
```

## Usage

- Navigate through the maze using the **arrow keys** or the **on-screen controls buttons**.
- Click the **Regenerate Maze** button below the canvas to start a new game with a new maze layout.
